        <h4>What is an 'automatic time tracking link' for Github Issues?</h4>
        <p>The Time-Tracker can be configured to automatically add a weblink pointing to your time tracker profile on every Github Issue in your repositories. Both existing issues and newly created issues will be affected. This feature is meant to provide you with an easy and convient way of tracking time within Github issue tracking.</p>

        <h4>At what interval are the links added to issues?</h4>
        <p>Existing issues will benefit from this feature once you active a repository in TimeTrack and enable the 'automatic time-tracking link' option. Newly created issues will also be assigned a link instantly on creation, by means of the Github hooks API.</p>

        <h4>Where did you get this awesome Stopwatch Icon?</h4>
        <p><a href="http://thenounproject.com/term/stopwatch/282/">The Stopwatch icon</a> was designed by <a href="http://thenounproject.com/edward">Edward Boatman</a> from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/">the Noun Project</a>. Go check it out if you're ever in need of an expressive icon.</p>

        <h4>What is an 'access token' and where can I get mine?</h4>
        <p>The access token is used to access all your Github issues to add 'Log now' links pointing to the Time-Tracker. It serves as a means of authentification to the Github server. You can get your access token by creating one in your Github user's profile under the 'Application' category. For more information see the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use">Github help.</a></p>

        <h4>How can I change the Time-Tracker's access permission to my Github account after signing up?</h4>
        <p>Changing the permission from access to your public repositories to include your private ones as well is easy. Just log out of Time-Tracker and log in again selecting 'Allow Private Access'.</br>
        Unfortunately, the other way around requires a little bit more work. You need to completely revoke Time-Tracker's access to Github using the Github <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use">application settings.</a> Upon your next log in to Time-Tracker you will be asked again for permission and can choose 'Allow public access'.</p>
